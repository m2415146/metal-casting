# metal-casting
training task: filling a 3D printed mold with metal

## description

This is a laboratory work on the subject of "Modern production technologies". The task is to make a 3d printed figure up to 10 * 10 cm in size on a 3D printer from a PLA filament, which we will use to make a gypsum mold, into which we will later pour aluminum. The task is to try the metal casting method in practice.

## important notes

in order to save time, I used a 3D model of the tooth (since the task is not to model from scratch, but to practice).  If I have some extra time, I'll try to model something on my own.

## 3d printing

### slicing

using Orcaslicer v 2.2. 
to model the profits, I used the create primitive function in the slicer. they are 3 cones. also, to get out the leftovers, I also used the function of creating primitive models in the slicer - these are 3 cylinders. for better printing, the cylinders are slightly recessed into the plane of the table - this is necessary in order to increase the contact area of the part with the first layer of the printing table.

I also installed tree support (in auto mode, it suited me) to improve the printing of overhangs.

FIlament - PLA Geeetech (purple). I chose this filament because it is the most trouble-free in my personal FDM printing practice. The teacher recommended using transparent PLA, but I don't think it will be a big problem.

the filament was open and I hadn't dried it beforehand. I hope that this will not affect the print quality much. printing is done from the Creality thermal camera, the temperature is set to 50 degrees Celsius for PLA.

Unfortunately the main model of the tooth was not printed - in the morning I found noodles instead of it - the rest of the primitive models and the roots of the tooth itself turned out.

## Problem solving: crutches

since the main task is to practice metal casting, the deadline for the laboratory work itself came up and I no longer had time to print something again, I decided to take a ready-made model - a soldier of the Chinese tin army. This model is larger than the ones that should be suitable for my task, but its shape is suitable for casting metal.

Its about 19+cm height

other parts from wrong printing I decided to use it to create casting channels.

in order to connect these parts to the model, I decided to use a lighter. Since PLA melts at low enough temperatures, it won't be difficult for me for a long time.

Initially, I wanted to use a plastic bottle as a mold for casting plaster (1,5 l).

![Screenshot_183](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b6265b9-93d9-4033-b37c-957549d4b0e0)

to correct the bottle, to make it easier to pour plaster into it, I used scissors.

The initial fitting was fine with me and I decided to attach the metal casting parts to the model by preheating them with a lighter.

previously, I fitted the model to the bottle again and cut out the holes with scissors to accommodate the injection channels.

![Screenshot_186](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c86a422a-3ad6-4556-a0f6-9a98d0ee4c92)

In order not to ruin the model, I attached the first of the channels to the model pad.

![Screenshot_187](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d4fd6e31-b613-4550-a8de-ec8ee2ea0b29)

However, I soon realized that it was not worth using the front part of the model for this, since the rest of the injection molding channels would have to be placed on the chest and face of the figure, and I took it off.

![Screenshot_188](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c0b1c9b0-1c8b-4322-abcd-af654e939d63)

then I installed 2 injection channels on the back of the model and tried it on in the bottle again.

![Screenshot_189](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1b637f2-4c41-4786-9200-777b85cffef3)

in order to increase the area of the injection channels when pouring plaster, I used ordinary adhesive tape.

![Screenshot_191](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ed9f7b2-78c9-4492-92fd-18e4d2cb9bf5)

at this point, it became clear that the bottle was not very appropriate for this task, and I decided to look for another container. The class time was limited, so I had to choose from the materials at hand. So, I took an empty cardboard box from the filament

![Screenshot_192](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63a02539-32bc-4ed9-b1c4-14a94c4994c5)

there was another problem: it was necessary to fix the model in the box so that it would be stationary during the casting and during its curing. I thought I could solve this if I positioned the model slightly at an angle so that it would lock into the box without rotation or displacement (it later turned out that the idea was not the most successful).

![Screenshot_193](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03957680-b2b9-4334-be98-745986469165)

then I got ready to mix the plaster. It was decided to use the proportions that the teacher suggested to us - 5 parts gypsum, 2 parts water, 1 part sand (by weight).

![Screenshot_194](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a5c3b1d-e91f-4df1-9872-7adc7a924feb)

Scales were used to measure the amount of material, gypsum, sand, and water were poured into a plastic container. I had to stir the mixture using improvised materials - a plastic measuring spoon (not in the photo)

![Screenshot_195](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c55e7b20-6f0d-436c-bb1f-aeab15d35ca1)

to avoid spilling plaster from the box, it was decided to wrap it with duct tape.

![Screenshot_196](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f293ad5-5d72-4ab2-afc1-bcbaf40db3c4)

for additional sealing, I tried using a plastic bag from under the filament, but it got stuck on the bottom third of the box, so I had to cut that part off. which didn't fit

![Screenshot_197](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e81181a5-068a-4755-b2eb-f2b13d2e89f8)

then I added a trash bag.

![Screenshot_198](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2af1c94f-d943-466a-a1f9-0ecded9306cf)

![Screenshot_199](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24ea2c66-40a9-43e3-b093-387281dee112)

It seemed to me that the figure touches the walls in 2 places, and in order not to spoil the edges of the figure during filling, I laid 2 cut-off pieces from the plastic bag from the filament that I cut earlier.

![Screenshot_200](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54ff271e-fdb4-4edb-b688-851fa2e14747)

I used a vibrating table to fill the box with plaster. it is necessary for the plaster to be evenly distributed inside the box and along the figure, as well as for air bubbles to escape.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06c6202f-4100-4860-ba54-c0effa704bc2

it seemed to me that the proportions for making the gypsum mixture that the teacher provided to us were not quite correct: the mixture turns out to be too liquid. this increases fragility and a high risk of blistering. therefore, starting with the next portion of the mixture (it took several of them for such a volume), I mixed the mixture by eye, adding more gypsum to it so that the consistency of the mixture resembled sour cream (as in a dental laboratory in dentistry).

Important notes: for a better filling of the mixture, it is better to pour it over the wall of the box. It is very important to avoid lumps (given the lack of a kneading tool, it was not easy). it also turned out that the tape and bags around the box were not superfluous - the excess plaster poured into the bag, but the space around remained clean.

### After 3 days

I came to check the condition of the model. my goal was to check the model and, if everything is in order, then put it in the oven for a day or two to dry the plaster faster and move on to the next stage as soon as possible. I want to speed up, because I already understand that this is a rough draft of the project, which will allow me to better understand the principles of metal casting in order to make it right again.

this is a view of the plaster on top of the box

![Screenshot_63](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e6afdd5-ce68-4e30-a439-622906677cc1)

visually, everything was not bad, so I decided to check how solidified the plaster was (using my fingers)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c37f7942-931a-43d6-a311-2a2630fbc6ad

The plaster was able to hold its shape to the touch, but it was quite wet. so the idea of heating it up for additional drying seems more and more relevant. I was somewhat surprised that the plaster had not dried in 3 days. I compare this plaster with dental casts, which, depending on the type, would definitely be ready for use in 2-3 hours. 

The next step is to remove the cardboard box and bags to prepare the model for moving to the oven. I did this step with a stationery knife and ordinary scissors.

![Screenshot_64](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3285aecd-11fc-4195-936c-a2035a66a929)

Unfortunately, after I removed the box and packages, defects were found - part of the box was sealed in plaster and part of the model was not well filled with plaster. in order not to damage the model when trying to remove the plaster and not waste time on re-pouring, I decided to simply add more plaster to these areas - since this is a training (rough) project, some defects are quite acceptable.

![Screenshot_65](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75ecfbaa-b4ca-4919-8280-5217fc32c7b7)

It should be noted the reason why it will be necessary to cover the cardboard box with plaster, which is immured in it: since we will place the blank in an oven for heating at 500 degrees Celsius to burn out the model from pla, there is a danger of open fire. According to the teacher, the PLA will not burn (I will pay attention to checking the answer to this question later). so I need to cover the cardboard part with plaster to avoid air access during heating in the oven and avoid the appearance of an open fire (smoke detectors are installed in the laboratory and this can lead to a number of problems).

to do this, I also diluted the gypsum mixture to cover these areas.
