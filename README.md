# metal-casting
training task: filling a 3D printed mold with metal

## description

This is a laboratory work on the subject of "Modern production technologies". The task is to make a 3d printed figure up to 10 * 10 cm in size on a 3D printer from a PLA filament, which we will use to make a gypsum mold, into which we will later pour aluminum. The task is to try the metal casting method in practice.

## important notes

in order to save time, I used a 3D model of the tooth (since the task is not to model from scratch, but to practice).  If I have some extra time, I'll try to model something on my own.

## 3d printing

### slicing

using Orcaslicer v 2.2. 
to model the profits, I used the create primitive function in the slicer. they are 3 cones. also, to get out the leftovers, I also used the function of creating primitive models in the slicer - these are 3 cylinders. for better printing, the cylinders are slightly recessed into the plane of the table - this is necessary in order to increase the contact area of the part with the first layer of the printing table.

I also installed tree support (in auto mode, it suited me) to improve the printing of overhangs.

FIlament - PLA Geeetech (purple). I chose this filament because it is the most trouble-free in my personal FDM printing practice. The teacher recommended using transparent PLA, but I don't think it will be a big problem.

the filament was open and I hadn't dried it beforehand. I hope that this will not affect the print quality much. printing is done from the Creality thermal camera, the temperature is set to 50 degrees Celsius for PLA.

Unfortunately the main model of the tooth was not printed - in the morning I found noodles instead of it - the rest of the primitive models and the roots of the tooth itself turned out.

## Problem solving: crutches

since the main task is to practice metal casting, the deadline for the laboratory work itself came up and I no longer had time to print something again, I decided to take a ready-made model - a soldier of the Chinese tin army. This model is larger than the ones that should be suitable for my task, but its shape is suitable for casting metal.
